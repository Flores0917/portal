       <p> Hello and welcome! I am an emerging professional and I am currently in a progam called YearUp and will be starting my intership sometime in March of 2023. My coding skills
        consist of HTML, CSS, Javascript. I will be taking more classes and earn my certicates to be proffiecent in other coding languages in the near future.</p>

       <p>Although I am new to coding, I feel right at home. I have always enjoyed building computers, and now that I am learning how to code I will defiently enjoy it! 
        My past exerience had helped me develop my people management skills/project lead as I was a foreman for a painting company. I know how to be a leader when a leader is needed and I also know
        how to be a listener and provide support.</p>

       
       <p>A year from now I expect myself to be working at a major comapny, if not looking for ways to accomplish my goal. My goal is to be software engineer or a quality assurance 
        engineer, either of those goals would make me very happy. Once my finacials are steady my plan is to work hard to try and help others that would like to learn how to code and give them the
        opportunity that was givin to me. </p>
       
       <p>If you are thinking to yourself, "Do I like my career?", "Do I want to keep working here?", "Is it even possible to accomplish my dream?" Let me be the first to tell you YES! I will be the first
        in my family to be in the tech world! I am so proud of that, If I can do it then you can too! I encourge you to look into it and find the support you need. I got tired of not working at my 
        career job, the point is to work hard and have fun while doing so! </p>
    
       <p> Going outside is big for me, I beleive it is a crucial part in the recovery proccess of your mind. Something as simple as going out for a walk on the beach (my favorite)
        hearing waves hit the rocks really relaxes you, so when you come back to sit on your computer and code you are ready to go, Helps your mental health tremendously!   </p>
